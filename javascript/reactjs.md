Main concept:

- `Dispatch`: send the action
- `Action`: has the { type: action-type, payload: data-to-transfer } and goes to store. `Actions` are plain JS objects
- `Store`: Contains `state` and `reducer` to handle state changes. `Reducers` specify how the state should be updated based on those `actions`
